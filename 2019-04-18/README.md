# Tech Karo - April 18, 2019

## In-Class

We studied:

- HTML Forms Validations
- Boolean attributes
- Some new VSCode Extensions
- Some new HTML tags

---

### HTML Form Validations:

To make sure the user enters data in the correct format.

**Examples:**

- Age should be a positive number, i.e. greater than 0
- Full name should be a required field
- Email field should not accept home address

Please refer to the repo code for further information

---

### Boolean Attributes

Boolean means "true/false". A boolean attribute has only 2 values:

- Its presence means value is true
- Its absence means value is false

**Examples:**
- [`required` attribute in `<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#required)
- [`autofocus` attribute in `<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autofocus)
- [`disabled` attribute in `<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#disabled)

---

### Some new VSCode extensions

We checkout the following amazing VSCode extensions and we highly recommend that you install them:

- [Live HTML Previewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hdg.live-html-previewer) (To preview HTML output inside VSCode)
- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) (To automatically rename paired HTML tag)

---

### Some new HTML Tags / Concepts

We also studied the following HTML tags / concepts:

- [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)
- [`<hgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hgroup)
- [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)
- [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)
- [`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)
- [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)
- [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)
- [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside)
- [`<figure>` / `<figcaption>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)
- [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) / [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
  - Please checkout out the [other Form-related HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms) tags also, like [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)
  - Practice the `<label>` tag and its `for` attribute
- [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms)

**Semantic HTML Layout Elements Diagram**
We have studied the following Semantic HTML Layout elements:
`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<main>`, `<aside>` and `<nav>`

[Here's a useful diagram from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp):

**Difference Between**
```
<button>Click Me!</button>
``` 
and 
```
<input type="button" value="Click Me!">
```

You cannot add images/icons inside an `<input type="button">`
